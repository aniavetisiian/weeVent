        News is information about current events. This may be provided through
        many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems,
        broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of
        observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called "hard news"
        to differentiate it from soft media. Common topics for news reports
        include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment,
        economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky
        or unusual events. Government proclamations, concerning royal
        ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed
        news since ancient times. Technological and social developments, often
        driven by government communication and espionage networks, have
        increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced
        its content.
